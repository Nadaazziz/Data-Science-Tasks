Data Science Internship Tasks – Coveda
 Week 1 – Data Science Foundations

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during Week 1 of my Data Science Internship at Coveda.
Each notebook includes code, analysis, and insights for different stages of the data workflow — from data collection to visualization.
 Task 1: Data Collection and Web Scraping

Goal: Collect real-world data using Python web scraping tools.

What I did:

Identified a target website and inspected its structure.

Used BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape structured data.

Stored the scraped data into CSV and JSON formats.

Handled challenges such as pagination and dynamic content.

Tools: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas

 Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Goal: Clean and prepare raw data for analysis.

What I did:

Handled missing data using imputation and removal.

Detected and removed outliers using IQR and Z-score.

Converted categorical variables into numerical formats with one-hot and label encoding.

Normalized and standardized numerical data for consistency.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Explore and visualize the data to find patterns and relationships.

What I did:

Computed summary statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.).

Visualized the data using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

Identified correlations between numerical features using a correlation matrix and heatmap.

Summarized insights and trends from the data.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
